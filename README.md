## What is Redline?
Redline is a massive script intended for tons of customization and configuration. 

It is designed after and inspired by the many popular hacked clients of Minecraft, such as

- [Meteor](https://meteorclient.com/) - UI design
- [Entropy](https://entropy.club) - UI theme
- [Impact](https://impactclient.net/)
- [Wurst](https://wurstclient.net/)
- [Aristois](https://aristois.net/)

**Note that this is not for Roblox Bedwars, Roblox Skywars, or other similar games.** This is a universal script intended to work across many / all games.

## Why use it?
- **Customizablity.** Nearly every module has tons of settings to toy around with.
- **Features.** Redline has tons of unique features that have never been seen, such as Discord Rich Presence.
- **Speed.** Redline is designed to be super fast and easy to use.  No annoying menus to navigate, no textboxes to type in, and no clutter on your screen.
- **Optimization & Security.** Every module is extremely optimized and has some anticheat bypass measures. This lets you safely and smoothly exploit without getting banned.
