## What is Redline?
Redline is a massive script intended for tons of customization and configuration. 

It is designed after and inspired by the many popular hacked clients of Minecraft, such as

- [Meteor](https://meteorclient.com/)'s UI
- [Entropy](https://entropy.club)'s color palette
- [Impact](https://impactclient.net/)'s features
- [Wurst](https://wurstclient.net/)'s features
- [Aristois](https://aristois.net/)'s features + UI
- [Inertia](https://inertiaclient.com)'s features

>**Note that this is not for Roblox Bedwars, Roblox Skywars, or other similar games.** This is a universal script intended to work across many / all games.

>**Note that Redline is still in beta.** Many features may not work yet.

## Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topitbopit/Redline/main/loader.lua'), 'redline is pretty epic')()
```

## Why use it?
- **Customizability.** Nearly every module has tons of settings to toy around with.
- **Features.** Redline has tons of unique features that have never been seen, such as Discord Rich Presence.
- **Speed.** Redline is designed to be super fast and easy to use.  No annoying menus to navigate, no textboxes to type in, and no clutter on your screen.
- **Optimization & Security.** Every module is extremely optimized and has anticheat bypass measures. This lets you safely and smoothly exploit without getting banned. 
>*Note that bypasses are universal and not a game per game basis, so certain anticheats may still detect you. Make sure to use an alt!*
