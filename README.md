## Notice
**This is in insanely early beta! Only like 12 things actually work (and some are still unfinished)**  

## What is Redline?
Redline is a massive *universal* script designed for lots of customization, ease of use, and many unique features. 

It is designed after and inspired by the many popular hacked clients of Minecraft, such as [Meteor](https://meteorclient.com/), [Entropy](https://entropy.club), and [Impact](https://impactclient.net/).   

>**Note that this is not for Roblox Bedwars, Roblox Skywars, or other similar games.** This is a universal script intended to work across many / all games.

## Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topitbopit/Redline/main/loader.lua'), 'redline is pretty epic')()
```

## Why use it?
- **Customizability.** Nearly every module has tons of settings to toy around with.  
- **Features.** Redline has tons of features that you won't find anywhere else, such as Nofall.  
- **Speed.** Redline is designed to be super fast and easy to use. No annoying menus to navigate, no textboxes to type in, and no clutter on your screen.  
- **Optimization.** Every module is extremely optimized. Even on lower end hardware, Redline will still run quick.  
- **Security.** Many uncommon checks in local anticheats are bypassed, and nearly every Redline module is handled in a unique, hard-to-detect way. This is definitely safer than other universal scripts.  
>*Note that bypasses are universal and not a game per game basis, so certain anticheats may still detect you. Make sure to use an alt*

## Q/A
**This mod is detected in this game**   
Open up an issue or DM me (jeffismyname#4316) and I'll check it out.  
Note that game specific serverside anticheats are not gonna be bypassed. (ex. Jailbreak or Phantom forces)  
**When will UI configuration be added?**    
There is no ETA, but it will eventually be added in another window.   
**Can I whitelist my friends from a certain mod (ex. prevent them from setting off antifling or triggerbot)?**  
Although there is no menu to add friends yet, Redline does have internal support for a friends list and player whitelisting. It will be added soon.    
**Can I use the ui library?**   
Sure, but Redline's UI is lacking a lot of features (like color pickers) that likely won't be added. Also, read the question below.   
**Can I copy / use some of the code?**   
Yes. However, Redline is under the GPL 3 license. Make sure your project follows that license if you copy/paste anything.    
If you want to instead just remake what I did but use the same methods (ex. flight, speed), then go ahead     
**What does X module do**    
Open up an issue or DM me if a module description isn't clear   
**Why won't Redline execute?**  
Make sure your executor is supported. Open up an issue / DM me the error you get.   

## Supported executors  
- Synapse X, fully tested   
- Comet, fully tested  
- Fluxus, fully tested  
Others may work and will be tested soon.
